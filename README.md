## Getting Started

*Warning: This is our very first Node.js application. We don't know if the way we setup the folder structure would offend a Node.js Developer. Feedback encouraged :)*

* Install Node.js with your packagemanager
* Install SASS via `gem install sass`
* `cd` into this directory and run `npm install` to install all dependencies
* Start the server via `node kickstart.js`
* Point your Webbrowser to [Port 8080](http://192.168.1.45:8080/) and have fun!

## Comfort

* The clientside CoffeeScript and SASS files will automatically re-compile on save :)

## Current Third Party Stuff

### CSS

* [Normalize.css](http://github.com/necolas/normalize.css): A better "CSS Reset"

### JavaScript

* [Faye](http://faye.jcoglan.com/): Pub/Sub for Node.js and the Browser
* [domready](https://github.com/ded/domready): Calls a function, when the DOM is ready
* [keymaster](https://github.com/madrobby/keymaster): The best tool for getting keyboard input
